## Description
This is a `Flutter` application that implements the mobile client for the **self-parking car**. This software is part of the [JavaScript self-parking car project](https://github.com/gcornetta/self-parking-car).

## Usage


## Software requirements
This software has been tested with `Flutter v.2.8.1` and `Dart v.2.15.1`. on `Visual Studio Code`. You need to install the following VSCode plugins:
1. Dart (Dart language support and debugger for Visual Studio Code). I have installed `v.3.46.1`.
2. Flutter (Flutter support and debugger for Visual Studio Code) .I have installed `v.3.46.0`.

Flutter relies on `Xcode` to generate code for IoS devices and on `Android Studio` to generate code for Android devices. Installing and configuring flutter is a long and tedious process. Please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) to install Flutter.
